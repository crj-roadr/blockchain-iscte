# Blockchain project

The proposed project objective is to use blockchain technology to create a solution for learning. This solution would be for two types of users and would have the following features: 
For Students :
 - We will use the blockchain technology to incentivize students (i.e. gamification) to improve their academic performance while they earn cryptocurrency.
For Institutions or Educators:
 - They will be able to issue documents authenticated (e.g., certificates, diplomas, or any institutional document) via NFTs
